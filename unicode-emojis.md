# Unicode emojis

## About 

Emojis as unicode characters - these can be copied and pasted and used in text files and even websites. Note that appearance will differ between devices but meaning should be the same.

This is unicode - contrast with GitHub emojis `:NAME:`.

## Reference

Here is a cheatsheet reference of a lot of emojis. I've made this shorter than the full list, to keep it more relevant for me and less noisy and obscure. The guide is not meant to be complete.

I inserted these using a mobile device, following the sections and mostly sticking to the order of emojis as they appear. I split where there seemed like natural groupings.
